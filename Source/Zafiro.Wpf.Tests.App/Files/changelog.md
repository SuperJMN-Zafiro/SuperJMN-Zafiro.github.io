![image](battery.png)

Please make sure your battery is fully charged before installing this driver pack. For most batteries the charge must be 100% as the phone may shutdown during setup if the battery is even at 80% charge.
Make sure battery is charged to 100% before continuing. If this is not the case, reboot your device **now** and charge it in an **Operating System**.

Reminder: if you are using WOA Deployer, **please** do not use the "Force Dual Boot" button, otherwise the setup process
will FAIL.

Changelog

![image](glance.jpg)

- Ported over glance screen. A couple of notes about glance screen in this release:

  Current issues with glance screen:

  - When the glance screen times out after the time specified there's a chance the screen won't turn off, this is still needing investigation but the issue can only be two things:
  — either the device got out of S0ix and is sleeping at a lower level, because wifi is not connected for example, as a result the glance service is unable to take actions, this is a problem
  — or, the glance service is trying to clear the screen, (there's a specific panel driver command to do so), and for some reason this is failing.
  This specific issue might take some time to completely iron out.

  - The following status notifications are not implemented in the port/non functional in the wrapper libraries:
  — Battery saver indication
  — Ringer indication (vibrate on, silence on)
  — Alarm indication
  — Detailed text indication
  — Notification badges

  - The following functionality is not implemented:
  — Wake glance on single tap


  To answer one main question we saw repeated a lot, (we did answer it in the discussion group that you probably want to join)

  - Yes, the clock moves vertically to prevent oled burnin, this feature is absent on OS Glance, which was introduced in Windows 10 Redstone 2, but is present in the old implementation, which is what this port uses

  - Yes, this is the original glance implementation by nokia ported over with wrapper libraries so it would work "fine"

    As a result, this means you do not have the 5 minutes timeout option that OS Glance had with Redstone 2

  - No, this is not the prerelease glance that had application/sdk support. Getting that one working is a bit more difficult, and wouldn't bring much different.

  - Are we thinking about making our own implementation?

    Yes we are kinda, mainly because of the timeout issue, if it doesn't manage to get fixed, we will have to roll our own implementation unfortunately. Also the battery saver indication issue might be tough to fix, currently it is NOP'd in the binary, but we would have to reimplement a windows phone winrt api to wrap this around

    For the other issues, we need to implement such functionality in the wrapper.

  - Syncing the background wallpaper is also a task that needs to be done, and might get tricky.

- Fixed an issue impacting Color Profile toggle functionality in action center
- Improvements to Color Profiles

![image](settings.png)

- General improvements to system applications. System applications are no longer present under the extras section of the settings application but instead can be found according to the following table:

   - Advanced Info => Bluetooth and other devices

   - Touch => Touch

   - Vibration => Notifications

   - USB Function Mode => USB

   - Color Profile => Display

   - Glance Screen => Lockscreen


- A new touch settings app was introduced in this release, but is not yet functional
- Removed the vidstream device from the default usb function configuration, as this could prevent power vetos
- Other general bug fixes

How to offline update an existing Windows Desktop installation

- Switch the device into mass storage.
- Take note of the drive letter the Windows partition is using, here we will assume it got mounted as I:

- Download [Lumia-Drivers-Full.zip] from https://github.com/WOA-Project/Lumia-Drivers/releases/latest
- Extract said zip file to a folder of your choice, we will assume here we extracted it to C:\UpdatedDrivers
- Download the DriverUpdater utility from https://github.com/WOA-Project/DriverUpdater/releases/latest
- Open a command prompt as administrator, where the driver utility got downloaded

- If your device is a Lumia 950, execute the following command:
  
  DriverUpdater.exe C:\UpdatedDrivers\Lumia-Drivers-XXXX\definitions\Desktop\Internal\950.txt C:\UpdatedDrivers\Lumia-Drivers-XXXX\ I:\

- If your device is a Lumia 950 XL, execute the following command:
  
  DriverUpdater.exe C:\UpdatedDrivers\Lumia-Drivers-XXXX\definitions\Desktop\Internal\950xl.txt C:\UpdatedDrivers\Lumia-Drivers-XXXX\ I:\

- Reboot the device, the device will now begin PnP setup once again, and hopefully you will be back soon enough to your desktop
